This task-planner app is a personal project born from my struggle with time management and procrastination. I built the app after taking an intro Python course to combine my interest in computer science with a tool that actually helps me stay on task. The planner lets users add tasks with durations and automatically checks in when time’s up. If a task runs overtime, the app prompts the user and allows a short grace period—after 10 minutes it automatically starts the next item.
Beyond functionality, the project demonstrates my problem-solving approach and growing software skills (clean code, event loops, and user interaction). It’s both a technical exercise and a practical tool to strengthen executive functioning—planning, prioritizing, and self-monitoring. I plan to add reminders, calendar sync, and a polished UI so this app can help others facing similar challenges.
